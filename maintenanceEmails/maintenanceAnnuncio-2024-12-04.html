<h3>Important Update: Encoder Upgrade for IlNewyorkese Service</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Dear cibortv-zwan,</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to inform you that <b>Encoder-2</b> (IP address: 136.243.34.218), currently in use for your <b>IlNewyorkese</b> service, will undergo an upgrade and will be <b>offline</b> for several days starting from <b>Friday, 6 December 2024, at 16:00 GMT</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To ensure uninterrupted service, we have allocated a new encoder for your use: <b>Encoder-6</b> (IP address: 23.88.13.17).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please take note of this change and ensure that the IlNewyorkese stream is redirected to Encoder-6 by the scheduled downtime. Kindly stop sending the IlNewyorkese stream to Encoder-2 before the mentioned time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Important Note</b>: The RTMP URL you are using will remain the same except for the hostname, which you need to update to the new Encoder-6 (IP address: 23.88.13.17).</p>
<p></p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Should you have any questions or require assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Catra Media Management Services</p>
