			// The below object could contain optionally:
			// - ReferenceEncodingProfileKey or ReferenceEncodingProfileLabel to specify
			//		a specific profile
			// - StopIfReferenceProcessingError in case of multiple References,
			//		this boolean field specifies if the MMS has to continue or not

		// optional: set the frame rate. Options:
		// passthrough (0): Each frame is passed with its timestamp from the demuxer to the muxer.
		// cfr (1): Frames will be duplicated and dropped to achieve exactly the requested constant frame rate.
		// vfr (2): Frames are passed through with their timestamp or dropped so as to prevent 2 frames
		//		from having the same timestamp.
		// drop: As passthrough but destroys all timestamps, making the muxer generate fresh timestamps
		//		based on frame-rate.
		// auto (-1): Chooses between 1 and 2 depending on muxer capabilities. This is the default method.
		// default is "vfr"
