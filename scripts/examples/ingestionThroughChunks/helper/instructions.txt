To ingest large files into the MMS you have
- first to ingest the Workflow containing the Add-Content task
- next split the large file in little pieces and ingest them one by one. All those little ingesting will be associated to the previous Add-content task through his ingestionJobKey


Steps to ingest the content:
---------------------------
1. run ingestionWorkflow.sh to ingest the workflow
	i.e.: ./ingestionWorkflow.sh <mmsUserKey> <mmsAPIKey>

	The result/output will be a json where every task will have his ingestionJobKey:
{ "workflow": { "ingestionRootKey": 157313, "label": "ingestContent Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, "tasks": [ { "ingestionJobKey": 469030, "label": "Add Content Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469031, "label": "Frame Containing Face: Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469032, "label": "Encode image MMS_JPG_W240_H-200 (FrameContainingFace): Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469033, "label": "Encode image MMS_PNG_W240 (FrameContainingFace): Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469034, "label": "Encoding profiles (FrameContainingFace): Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469035, "label": "Frame: Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469036, "label": "Encode image MMS_JPG_W240_H-200 (Frame): Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469037, "label": "Encode image MMS_PNG_W240 (Frame): Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469038, "label": "Encoding profiles (* Connection #0 to host mms-api.cibortv-mms.com left intact
Frame): Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469039, "label": "Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469040, "label": "" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469041, "label": "Encode Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" }, { "ingestionJobKey": 469042, "label": "Miss-Italia-nel-mondo_720m_14-4" } ] }


2. mark the IngestionJobKey associated to the Add-Content task because it will be used in the next step when the media file will be ingested
	In the previous example, the ingestionJobKey ssociated to the Add-Content task is "ingestionJobKey": 469030
4. run ingestionBinary.sh script to ingest the media file
	i.e.: ./ingestionBinary.sh <mmsUserKey> <mmsAPIKey> <Add-Content ingestionJobKey> <media path name>


More details:

ingestionWorkflow.json
----------------------
it contains the workflow to be ingested. It consists of the following tasks:
	1. Add-Content task to ingest a new media file
	2. In case of success, in parallel it executes:
		2.1. 'Best Picture of the Video' Workflow-As-Library task to retrieve the best picture of the media content
		2.2. Encode task to add a specific HLS profile


ingestionWorkflow.sh
--------------------
It is a script to ingest the ingestionWorkflow.json Workflow
Usage: ./ingestionWorkflow.sh <mmsUserKey> <mmsAPIKey>


ingestionBinary.sh
-------------------------
it is the script to slit the media file in pieces and ingest them one by one
Usage: ./ingestionBinary.sh <mmsUserKey> <mmsAPIKey> <ingestion job key> <binary path name> [<chunk size in bytes]
